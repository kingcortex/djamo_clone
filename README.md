# 💳 Flutter UI Clone – Djamo App Screens

Hi there 👋🏾

This project is a **Flutter UI clone** of several screens from the Djamo mobile application.  
The goal was to reproduce the visual identity and layout with precision, using only Flutter widgets — no external UI libraries.

> 🙏 Special thanks to designer **Papa Mandaw DIOP** for the beautiful icons and illustrations that helped bring this clone to life.
